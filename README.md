### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a new technical writing opportunity. In my most recent project, I documented and enhanced the user experiences in on-prem and off-prem (SaaS) storage monitoring applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying advanced techniques for information architecture, UX design thinking, technical writing, and editing.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a role that aligns with my knowledge, experience, and passion for technical content.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experiences working on large and small technical writing teams and projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ck9252@gmail.com.
- âš¡ Fun fact: After moving from Chicago to Austin, I realized how great it could be eating outside at a restaurant on a warm day in January.
